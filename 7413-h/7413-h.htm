    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">AS the scope of the first series of these Tales
      seems to have been somewhat overlooked, a few words of introduction may
      not be out of place before this second volume.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">It seems that any simple form of fiction is
      supposed to be a "fairy tale:" which implies that it has to do with an
      impossible world of imaginary beings. Now the Egyptian Tales are exactly
      the opposite of this, they relate the doings and the thoughts of men and
      women who are human&mdash;sometimes "very human," as Mr. Balfour said.
      Whatever there is of supernatural elements is a very part of the beliefs
      and motives of the</span><br />

      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">people whose lives are here pictured. But most of
      what is here might happen in some corner of our own country to-day, where
      ancient beliefs may have a home. So far, then, from being fairy tales
      there is not a single being that could be termed a fairy in the whole of
      them.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Another notion that seems to be about is that the
      only possible object of reading any form of fiction is for pure amusement,
      to fill an idle hour and be forgotten and if these tales are not as
      amusing as some jester of to-day, then the idler says, Away with them as a
      failure! For such a person, who only looks to have the tedium of a vacuous
      mind relieved, these tales are not in the least intended. But the real and
      genuine charm of all fiction is that of enabling the reader to place
      himself in the mental position of, another, to see with the eyes, to feel
      with the thoughts, to reason with the mind, of a wholly different being.
      All the greatest work has this charm. It may be to place the reader</span><br />

      <span class="font17 c5">in new mental positions, or in a different level
      of the society that he already knows, either higher or lower; or it may be
      to make alive to him a society of a different land or age. Whether he read
      "Treasure Island" or "Plain Tales from the Hills," "The Scarlet Letter,"
      "Old Mortality," or "Hypatia," it is the transplanting of the reader into
      a new life, the doubling of his mental experience, that is the very power
      of fiction. The same interest attaches to these tales. In place of
      regarding Egyptians only as the builders of pyramids and the makers of
      mummies, we here see the men and women as they lived, their passions,
      their foibles, their beliefs, and their follies. The old refugee Sanehat
      craving to be buried with his ancestors in the blessed land, the
      enterprise and success of the Doomed Prince, the sweetness of Bata, the
      misfortunes of Ahura, these all live before us, and we can for a brief
      half hour share the feelings and see with the eyes of those who ruled the
      world when it was young. This is the real</span><br />

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">THERE was once in the time of King Men-kheper-ra a
      revolt of the servants of his majesty who were in Joppa; and his majesty
      said, "Let Tahutia go with his footmen and destroy this wicked Foe in
      Joppa." And he called one of his followers, and said moreover, "Hide thou
      my great cane, which works wonders, in the baggage of Tahutia that my
      power may go with him."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Now when Tahutia came near to Joppa, with all the
      footmen of Pharaoh, he sent unto the Foe in Joppa, and said, "Be</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">hold now his majesty, King Men-kheper-ra, has sent
      all this great army against thee; but what is that if my heart is as thy
      heart? Do thou come, and let us talk in the field, and see each other face
      to face." So Tahutia came with certain of his men; and the Foe in Joppa
      came likewise, but his charioteer that was with him was true of heart unto
      the king of Egypt. And they spoke with one another in his great tent,
      which Tahutia had placed far off from the soldiers. But Tahutia had made
      ready two hundred sacks, with cords and fetters, and had made a great sack
      of skins with bronze fetters, and many baskets: and they were in his tent,
      the sacks and the baskets, and he had placed them as the forage for the
      horses is put in baskets. For whilst the Foe in Joppa drank with Tahutia,
      the people who were with him drank with the footmen of Pharaoh, and made
      merry with them. And when their bout of drinking was past, Tahutia said to
      the Foe in Joppa, "If it please thee, while</span><br />

      and hobbled their horses, and gave them provender, and one found the great
      cane of Men-kheper-ra (Tahutmes III.), and came to tell of it to Tahutia.
      And thereupon the Foe in Joppa said to Tahutia, "My heart is set on

      thus, and he brought the cane of King Men-kheper-ra. And he laid hold on
      the Foe in Joppa by his garment, and he arose and stood up, and said,
      "Look on me, O Foe in Joppa; here is the great cane of King Men-kheper-ra,

      the Foe in Joppa, "Thy master is fallen; go, say to thy mistress, 'A

      his children; behold the beginning of their tribute,' that she may
      comprehend the two hundred sacks, which are full of men and cords and

      opened before the footmen: they entered the city, they opened their
      burdens, they laid hands on them of the city, both small and great, they
      put on them the cords and fetters quickly; the power of Pharaoh seized
      upon that city. After he had rested Tahutia sent a message to Egypt to the

      <span class="font18"><i>REMARKS</i></span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">This tale of the taking of Joppa appears to be
      probably on an historical basis. Tahutia was a well-known officer of
      Tahutmes III.; and the splendid embossed dish of weighty gold which the
      king presented to him is one of the principal treasures of the Louvre
      museum. It is ornamented with groups of fish in the flat bottom, and a
      long inscription around the side.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Unfortunately the earlier part of this tale has
      been lost; but in order to render it intelligible I have restored an
      opening to it, without introducing any details but what are alluded to, or
      necessitated, by the existing story. The original text begins at the star.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">the stratagem of the Egyptian general, offering to
      make friends with the rebel of Joppa, while he sought to trap him. To a
      Western soldier such an unblushing offer of being treacherous to his
      master the king would be enough to make the good faith of his proposals to
      the enemy very doubtful. But in the East offers of wholesale desertion are
      not rare. In Greek history it was quite an open question whether Athens or
      Persia would retain a general's service; in Byzantine history a commander
      might be in favour with the Khalif one year and with the Autokrator the
      next; and in the present century the entire transfer of the Turkish fleet
      to Mohammed Ali in 1840 is a grand instance of such a case.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The scheme of taking a fortress by means of
      smuggling in soldiers hidden in packages has often recurred in history;
      but this taking of Joppa is the oldest tale of the kind yet known.

      <span class="font18 c5">times the Arab scheme for taking Edessa, in 1038
      A.D., by a train of five hundred camels bearing presents for the
      Autokrator at Constantinople. The governor of Edessa declined to admit
      such travellers, and a bystander, hearing some talking in the baskets
      slung on the camels, soon gave the alarm, which led to the destruction of
      the whole party; the chief alone, less hands, ears, and nose, being left
      to take the tale back to Bagdad. And in fiction there are the stories of a
      lady avenging her husband by introducing men hidden in skins, and the best
      known version of all in the "Arabian Nights," of Ali Baba and the thieves.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">It appears from the tale that the conference of
      Tahutia with the rebel took place between the town and the Egyptian army,
      but near the town. Then Tahutia proposes to go into the town as a pledge
      of his sincerity, while the men of the town were to supply his troops with
      fodder. But he appears to have remained talking with the</span><br />

      stick turned up. This cleared the way for a neater management of his plan,
      by enabling him to quietly make away with the chief, without exciting his
      suspicions beforehand.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The name of the cane of the king is partly
      illegible; but we know how many actual sticks and personal objects have
      their own names inscribed on them. Nothing had a real entity to the
      Egyptian mind without an individual name belonging to it.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The message sent by the charioteer presupposes
      that he was in the secret; and he must therefore have been an Egyptian who
      had not heartily joined in the rebellion. From the conclusion we see that
      the captives taken as slaves to Egypt were by no means only prisoners of
      war, but were the ordinary civil inhabitants of the conquered cities,
      "them of the city, both small and great."</span><br />

      about seven inches across, with vertical sides an inch high. The inside of
      the bottom bears a boss and rosette in the centre, a line of swimming fish
      around that, and beyond all a chain of lotus flowers. On the upright edge
      is an incised inscription, "Given in praise by the king of Upper and Lower
      Egypt, <i>Ra-men-kheper,</i> to the hereditary chief, the divine father,
      the beloved by God, filling the heart of the king in all foreign lands and

      praised by the good gold lord of both lands and his <i>ka,&mdash;</i>the
      royal scribe Tahuti deceased." This splendid piece of gold work was
      therefore given in honour of Tahuti at his funeral, to be placed in his

      pound, being 5,729 grains or four utens. The allusion on it to the

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Beside this golden bowl there are many other
      objects from Tahuti's tomb which must have been very rich, and have
      escaped plundering until this century. A silver dish, broken, and a
      canopic jar of alabaster, are in Paris; another canopic jar, a palette, a
      kohl vase, and a heart scarab set in gold, are in Leyden; while in
      Darmstadt is the dagger of this great general. This piece of a popular
      tale founded on an incident of his Syrian wars has curiously survived,
      while the more solid official records of his conquests has perished in the
      wreck of history. His tomb even is unknown, although it has been
      plundered; perhaps his active life of foreign service did not give him
      that leisure to carve and decorate it, which was so laboriously spent by
      the home-living dignitaries of Thebes.</span><br />

      <span class="font18"><i>REMARKS</i></span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c5">This tale is preserved in one of the Harris papyri
      (No. 500) in the British Museum. It has been translated by Goodwin,
      Chabas, Maspero, and Ebers. The present version is adapted from that of
      Maspero, with frequent reference by Mr. Griffith to the original.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c5">The marvellous parentage of a fated or gifted hero
      is familiar in Eastern tales, and he is often described as a divine reward
      to a long-childless king. This element of fate or destiny is, however, not
      seen before this age in Egyptian ideas; nor, indeed, would it seem at all
      in place with the simple, easygoing, joyous life of the early days. It
      belongs to an age when ideals possess the mind, when man struggles against
      his circumstances, when he wills to be different from what he is. Dedi or
      the shipwrecked sailor think nothing about fate, but live day by day as
      life comes to them. There is here, then,</span><br />

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">a new element, that of striving and of unrest,
      quite foreign to the old Egyptian mind. The age of this tale is shown
      plainly in the incidents. The prince goes to the chief of Naharaina, a
      land probably unknown to the Egyptians until the Asiatic conquests of the
      XVIIIth Dynasty had led them to the upper waters of the Euphrates. In
      earlier days Sanehat fled to the frontier at the Wady Tumilat, and was
      quite lost to Egypt when he settled in the south of Palestine. But when
      the Doomed Prince goes out of Egypt he goes to the chief of Naharaina, as
      the frontier State. This stamps the tale as subsequent to the wars of the
      Tahutimes family, and reflects rather the peaceful intercourse of the
      great monarch Amenhotep the Third. If it belonged to the Ramessides we
      should not hear of Naharaina, which was quite lost to them, but rather of
      Dapur (Tabor) and Kadesh, and of the Hittites as the familiar frontier
      power.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">instead of the goddesses Isis, Nebhat, Mes-khent,
      and Hakt, of the old tale in the IVth Dynasty (see first series, p. 33);
      and we find in the next tale of Anpu and Bata, in the XlXth Dynasty, that
      the seven Hathors decree the fate of the wife of Bata. That Hathor should
      be a name given to seven deities is not strange when we see that Hathor
      was a generic name for a goddess. There was the Hathor of foreign lands,
      such as Punt or Sinai; there was the Hathor of home towns, as Dendera or
      Atfih; and Hathor was as widely known, and yet as local, as the Madonna.
      In short, to one of the races which composed the Egyptian people Hathor
      was the term for any goddess, or for a universal goddess to whom all
      others were assimilated. Why and how this title "house of Horus " should
      be so general is not obvious.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The variety of fate here predicted is like the
      vagueness of the fate of Bata's wife, by "a sharp death." It points to the
      Hathors</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">predicting as seers, rather than to their having
      the control of the future. It bears the stamp of the oracle of Delphi,
      rather than that of a divine decree. In this these goddesses differ
      greatly from the Parcae, whose ordinances not even Zeus could withstand,
      as Lucian lets us know in one of the most audacious and philosophical of
      the dialogues. The Hathors seem rather to deal with what we should call
      luck than with fate: they see the nature of the close of life from its
      beginning, without either knowing or controlling its details.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">In this tale we meet for the first time the idea
      of inaccessible and mysterious buildings; and from the resort to this
      element or curiosity in describing both the prince and the princess, it
      appears as if it were then a new motive in story-telling, and had not lost
      its power. To modern ears it is, of course, done to death since the
      "Castle of Otranto"; though as a minor element it can still be gently used
      by the poet and novelist in a</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">moated grange, a house in a marsh or a maze.
      Another point of wonder, so well known in later times, is the large and
      mystic number of windows, like the 365 windows attributed to great
      buildings of the present age. It would not be difficult from these papyrus
      tales to start an historical dictionary of the elements of fiction: a kind
      of analysis that should be the death of much of the venerable
      stock-in-trade.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">We see coming in here, more strongly than before,
      the use of emotions and the force of character. The generous friendship of
      the sons of the Syrian chiefs; then the burst of passionate love from the
      chiefs daughter, which saves the prince's life twice over from her father,
      and guards him afterwards from his fates; again, the devotion of the
      prince to his favourite dog, in spite of all warnings&mdash;these show a
      reliance on personal emotion and feeling in creating the interest of the
      tale, quite different from the mere interest of incident which was
      employed</span><br />
    </p>

      <span class="font18 c5">earlier. The reason which the prince alleges for
      his leaving Egypt is also a touch of nature, the wish of a mother to oust
      her stepson in order to make way for her own children, one of the deepest
      and most elemental feelings of feminine nature.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The mighty man and the crocodile are difficult to
      understand, the more so as the tale breaks off in the midst of that part.
      It appears also as if there had been some inversion of the paragraphs;
      for, first, we read that the wife would not let the prince go alone, and
      one goes with him toward Egypt, and the crocodile of the Nile (apparently)
      is mentioned; then he is said to be sitting in his house with his wife;
      then he goes in the fields of his domain and meets the crocodile. It may
      be that a passage has dropped out, describing his wife's accompanying him
      to settle in Egypt. But the mighty man&mdash;that is another puzzle. He
      binds a crocodile, and goes out while he is bound, but by night. The point
      of this is not clear. It may have 4-</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">been, however, that the mighty man went back to
      the house when the sun was high, that he might not lose his shadow. In
      Arabia there was a belief that a hyena could deprive a man of speech and
      motion by stepping on his shadow&mdash;analogous to the belief in many
      other lands of the importance of preserving the shadow, and avoiding the
      shadowless hour of high noon (Frazer, "Golden Bough," p. 143). Hence the
      strength of the mighty man, and his magic power over the crocodile, would
      perhaps depend on his not allowing his shadow to disappear. And though
      Egypt is not quite tropical, yet shadows do practically vanish in the
      summer, the shadow of the thin branches of a tall palm appearing to
      radiate round its root without the stem casting any shade.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The use of milk to entice serpents is still well
      known in Egypt; and when a serpent appeared in some of my excavations in a
      pit, the men proposed to me to let down a saucer of milk to entice it out,
      that they might kill it.</span><br />

      <span class="font19 c5">The close of the tale would have explained much
      that is now lost to us. The crocodile boasts of being the fate of the
      prince; but his dog is with him, and one can hardly doubt that the dog
      attacks the crocodile. There is also the mighty man to come in and manage
      the crocodile. Then the dog is left to bring about the catastrophe. Or
      does the faithful wife rescue him from all the fates? Hardly so, as the
      prediction of the Hathors comes strictly to pass in the tale of Anpu and
      Bata. Let us hope that another copy may be found to give us the clue to
      the working of the Egyptian mind in this situation.</span><br />

      down in his stable with the cattle. And at the dawn of day he took bread
      which he had baked, and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with
      him his bread to the field, and he drave his cattle to pasture in the

      next entering, she also said likewise. He looked beneath the door of the
      stable; he saw the feet of his elder brother; he was standing behind the
      door, and his knife was in his hand. He cast down his load to the ground,
      and betook himself to flee swiftly; and his elder brother pursued after
      him with his knife. Then the younger brother cried out unto Ra Harakhti,
      saying, "My good Lord! Thou art he who divides the evil from the good."
      And Ra stood and heard all his cry; and Ra made a wide water between him
      and his elder brother, and it was full of crocodiles; and the one brother
      was on one bank, and the other on the other bank; and the elder brother

      discerneth between the good and the evil. For I shall not be with thee any

      I am thy brother in truth, and thou art to me as a father, and thy wife

      a son. And one went to tell his majesty, "There is born to thee a son."
      And they brought him, and gave to him a nurse and servants; and there were
      rejoicings in the whole land. And the king sat making a merry day, as they
      were about the naming of him, and his majesty loved him exceedingly at

      had belonged to Sety II. when crown prince, and hence is of the XlXth
      Dynasty. Most of the great scholars of this age have worked at it: De
      Rouge, Goodwin, Renouf, Chabas, Brugsch, Ebers, Maspero, and Groff have
      all made original studies on it. The present translation is, however, a
      fresh one made by Mr. Griffith word for word, and shaped as little as
      possible by myself in editing it. The copy followed is the publication by
      Birch in "Select Papyri," part ii. pls. ix. to xix. Before considering the
      details of the story, we should notice an important question about its age
      and composition. That it is as old as the XlXth Dynasty in its present
      form is certain from the papyrus; but probably parts of it are older. The
      idyllic beauty of the opening of it, with the simplicity and directness of
      the ideas, and the absence of any impossible or marvellous feature, is in
      the strongest opposition to the latter part, where marvel is piled on

      <span class="font18 c5">pointless profusion. In the first few pages there
      is not a word superfluous or an idea out of place in drawing the picture.
      That we have to do with an older story lengthened out by some inartistic
      compiler, seems only too probable. And this is borne out by the colophon.
      In the tales of the Shipwrecked Sailor, and of Sanehat, the colophon runs&mdash;"This
      is finished from beginning to end, even as it was found in the writing,"
      and the earlier of these two tales follows this with a blessing on the
      transcriber. But, apparently conscious of his meddling, the author of Anpu
      and Bata ends with a curse: "Written by the scribe Anena, the owner of
      this roll. He who speaks against this roll, may Tahuti smite him." This
      points to a part of it at least being newly composed in Ramesside times;
      while the delicate beauty of the opening is not only far better than the
      latter part, but is out of harmony with the forced and artificial taste of
      the XlXth Dynasty. At the same time, the careful drawing of character is
      hardly akin to the simple, matter-</span><br />

      keeping with the emotional style of the Doomed Prince. If we attribute the
      earlier part to the opening of the XVIIIth Dynasty&mdash;the age of the

      <span class="font18 c5">The description of Bata is one of the most
      beautiful character-drawings in the past. The self-denial and sweet
      innocence of the lad, his sympathy with his cattle, "listening to all that
      they said," and allowing them their natural wishes and ways, is touchingly
      expressed. And those who know Egypt will know that Bata still lives there&mdash;several
      Batas I have known myself. His sweetness of manner, his devotion, his
      untiringly earnest work, his modesty, his quietness, makes Bata to be one
      of the most charming friends. Bata I have met in many places, Bata I have
      loved as one of the flowers of human nature, and Bata I hope often to meet

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The touches of description of Bata are slight, and
      yet so pointed. His growing to be an excellent worker; his return at
      evening laden with all the produce, just as may be seen now any evening as
      the lads come in bearing on their backs large bundles of vegetables for
      the house, and of fodder for the home-driven cattle; his sleeping with his
      cattle in the stable; his zeal in rising before dawn to make the daily
      bread for his brother, ready to give him when he arose; and then his
      driving out the cattle to pasture&mdash;all contrasts with his elder
      brother's life of ease. The making of the bread was rightly the duty of
      Anpu's wife; she ought to have risen to grind the corn long before dawn,
      as the millstones may now be heard grinding in the dark, morning by
      morning; she ought to have baked the bread ready for the toiler who spent
      his whole day in the field. But it was the ever-willing Bata who did the
      work of the house as well as</span><br />

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The driving in of the cattle at night is still a
      particular feature of Egyptian life. About an hour before sunset the
      tether ropes are drawn in the fields, and the cattle file off, with a
      little child for a leader&mdash;if any; the master gathers up the produce
      that is required, some buffalo is laden with a heap of clover, or a lad
      carries it on his back, for the evening feed of the cattle, and all troop
      along the path through the fields and by the canal. For two or three miles
      the road becomes more and more crowded with the flocks driven into it from
      every field, a long haze of dust lies glowing in the crimson glory of
      sunset over the stream of cows and buffaloes, sheep and goats, that pour
      into the village. Each beast well knows his master and his crib, and turns
      in at the familiar gate to the stable under the house, or by the side of
      the hut; and there all spend the night. Not a hoof is left out in the
      field; the last belated stragglers come in</span><br />

      night-blue sky behind the black horizon. Then the silent fields lie under
      the brightening moon, glittering with dew, untrodden and deserted. It is
      not cold or climate that leads men to this custom, but the unsafety of a
      country bordered by unseen deserts, whence untold men may suddenly appear
      and ravage all the plain.</span><br />

      banks and ridges appear, "the back-bones of the land," as they were so
      naturally called; and when the surface is firm enough to walk on&mdash;with
      many a pool and ditch still full&mdash;the ploughing begins on the soft
      dark clay</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The catastrophe of the story&mdash;the black gulf
      of deceit that suddenly opens under Bata's feet&mdash;has always been seen
      to be strikingly like the story of Joseph. And&mdash;as we have noticed&mdash;there
      is good reason for the early part of this tale belonging to about the
      beginning of the XVIIIth Dynasty, so it</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">is very closely allied in time as well as
      character to the account of Joseph. In this part again is one of those
      pointed touches, which show the power of the poet&mdash;for a poem in
      prose this is&mdash;"her heart knew him with the knowledge of youth."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">On reaching the mistaken revenge of Anpu, we see
      the sympathy of Bata with his cattle, and his way of reading their
      feelings, returned to him most fittingly by the cows perceiving the
      presence of the treachery. "He heard what his first cow had said; and the
      next entering she also said likewise."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">After this we find a change; instead of the simple
      and natural narrative, full of human feeling, and without a touch of
      impossibility, every subsequent episode involves the supernatural; Ra
      creating a wide water, the extraction of the soul of Bata, his miraculous
      wife, and all the transformations&mdash;these have nothing in common with
      the style or ideas of the earlier tale.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">much of it is drawn from other sources, we can
      hardly hope to explain from the fragments of literature that we have. But
      strangely there is a parallel which is close enough to suggest that the
      patchwork is due to popular mythology. In the myths of Phrygia we meet
      with Atys or Attis, of whom varying legends are told. Among these we glean
      that he was a shepherd, beautiful and chaste; that he fled from
      corruption; that he mutilated himself; lastly he died under a tree, and
      afterwards was revived. All this is a duplicate of the story of Bata. And
      looking further, we see parallels to the three subsequent transformations.
      Drops of blood were shed from the Atys-priest; and Bata, in his first
      transformation as a bull, sprinkles two drops of blood by the doors of the
      palace. Again, Atys is identified with a tree, which was cut down and
      taken into a sanctuary; and Bata in his second transformation is a Persea
      tree which is cut down and used in building. Lastly, the mother of Atys is
      said to have been a</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">virgin, who bore him from placing in her bosom a
      ripe almond or pomegranate; and in his third transformation Bata is born
      from a chip of a tree being swallowed by the princess. These resemblances
      in nearly all the main points are too close and continuous to be a mere
      chance, especially as such incidents are not found in any other Egyptian
      tale, nor in few&mdash;if any&mdash;other classical myths. It is not
      impossible that the names even may have been the same; for Bata, as we
      write it, was pronounced Vata (or Vatiu or Vitiou, as others would
      vocalise it), and the digamma would disappear in the later Greek form in
      which we have Atys.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The most likely course seems to have been that,
      starting with a simple Egyptian tale, the resemblance to the shepherd of
      the Asiatic myth, led to a Ramesside author improving the story by tacking
      on the branches of the myth one after another, and borrowing the name. If
      this be granted, we have here in Bata the earliest indications of the
      elements</span><br />

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Returning now from the general structure to the
      separate incidents, we note the expression of annoyance where the elder
      brother "smote twice on his hands." This gesture is very common in Egypt
      now, the two hands being rapidly slid one past the other, palm to palm,
      vertically, grating the fingers of one hand over the other; the right hand
      moving downwards, and the left a little up. This implies that there is
      nothing, that a thing is worthless, that a desired result has not been
      attained, or annoyance at want of success; but the latter meanings are now
      rare, and more latent than otherwise, and this tale points to the gesture
      being originally one of positive anger, though it has been transferred
      gradually to express mere negative results.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">mind. The idea of Bata taking out his heart, and
      placing it on the flower of a tree, has seemed hopelessly unintelligible.
      But it depends on what we are to understand by the heart in Egyptian. Two
      words are well known for it, <i>hati</i> and <i>ah;</i> and as it is
      unlikely that these should be mere synonyms, we have a presumption that
      one of them does not mean the physical heart, but rather the mental heart.
      We are accustomed to the same mixture of thought; and far the more common
      usage in English is not to employ the name to express the physical heart,
      but for the will, as when we say "good-hearted";&mdash;for the spring of
      action, "broken-hearted ";&mdash;for the feelings, "hard-hearted";&mdash;for
      the passions, "an affair of the heart";&mdash;or for the vigour, as when a
      man in nature or in act is "hearty" The Egyptian, with his metaphysical
      mind, took two different words where we only use one; and when we read of
      placing the heart <i>(hati)</i> out of a man, we are led at once by the
      analogy of beliefs in</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">other races to understand this as the vitality or
      soul. In the "Golden Bough" Mr. Frazer has explained this part of natural
      metaphysics; and in this, and the following points, I freely quote from
      that work as a convenient text-book. The soul or vitality of a man is
      thought of as separable from the body at will, and therefore communicable
      to other objects or positions. In those positions it cannot be harmed by
      what happens to the body, which is therefore deathless for the time. But
      if the external seat of the soul be attacked or destroyed, the man
      immediately dies. This is illustrated from the Norse, Saxons, Celts,
      Italians, Greeks, Kabyles, Arabs, Hindus, Malays, Mongolians, Tartars,
      Magyars, and Slavonians. It may well, then, be considered as a piece of
      inherent psychology: and following this interpretation, I have rendered
      "heart" in this sense "soul" in the translation.</span><br />

      always the formative god, who makes man upon the potter's wheel, as in the
      scene in the temple of Luqsor. And even in natural birth it was Khnumu who
      "gave strength to the limbs," as in the earlier "Tales of the Magicians."
      The character of the wife of Bata is a very curious study. The total
      absence of the affections in her was probably designed as in accord with
      her non-natural formation, as she could not inherit aught from human
      parents. Ambition appears as the only emotion of this being; her attacks
      on the transformations of Bata are not due to dislike, but only to fear
      that he should claim her removal from her high station; she "feared
      exceedingly for the words that her husband had spoken to her." Her Lilith
      nature is incapable of any craving but that for power.</span><br />

      it to be a mythical form of a raid of pirates, who, not catching the

      with ornaments, anticipates the modern novelist's saying, "Set a woman to

      depository of his soul was destroyed, is a usual feature in such tales
      about souls. But it is only in the Indian forms quoted by Mr. Frazer that
      there is any revival of the dead; and in no case is there any

      <span class="font18 c5">The first transformation of Bata, into a bull, is

      marks on the back and other parts were the tokens of the true Apis, who
      was sought for anxiously through the country on the death of the sacred
      animal who had lived in the sanctuary. The man who, like Anpu, brought up

      great feast with offerings to the ox before sacrificing it, appears
      inexplicable until we note the habits of other peoples in slaying their
      sacred animals at certain intervals. This tale shows us what is stated by
      Greek authors, that the Egyptians slew the sacred Apis at stated times, or
      when a new one was discovered with the right marks. The annual sacrifice
      of a sacred ram at Thebes shows that the Egyptians were familiar with such
      an idea. And though it was considered by the writer of this tale as a
      monstrous act, yet the offerings and festivity which accompanied it are in

      liver is the seat of the soul ("Golden Bough," ii. 88); and hence if she
      ate the liver she would destroy the soul of Bata, or prevent it entering
      any other incarnation.</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The next detail is also curiously significant. If
      a bull was being sacrificed we should naturally suppose the blood would
      flow, and that a few drops would not be noticed. Here, however, two drops
      are said to fall, and this was when the bull "was upon the shoulders of
      the people." Now it is a very general idea that blood must not be allowed
      to fall upon the ground; the eastern and southern Africans will not shed
      the blood of cattle ("Golden Bough," i. 182); and strangely the
      Australians avoid the falling of blood to the ground by placing the
      bleeding persons upon the shoulders of other men. This parallel is so
      close to the Egyptian tale that it seems as if the bull was borne "on the
      shoulders of the people," that his blood should not fall to the ground;
      yet in spite of</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">this precaution "he shook his neck, and he threw
      two drops of blood over against the doors of his majesty." In these drops
      of blood was the soul of Bata, in spite of the princess having eaten his
      liver; and we know how among Jews, Arabs, and other peoples, the blood is
      regarded as the vehicle of the soul or life.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The evidence of tree worship is plainer here than
      perhaps in any other passage of Egyptian literature. The people rejoice
      for the two Persea trees, "and there were offerings made to them."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The blue crown worn by the king was the war cap of
      leather covered with scales of copper: it is often found made in dark blue
      glaze for statuettes, and it seems probable that the copper was
      superficially sulphurised to tint it. Such head-dress was usually worn by
      kings when riding in their chariots. The pale gold or electrum here
      mentioned was the general material for decorating the royal chariot.</span><br />

      <span class="font19 c5">The miraculous birth of Bata in his third
      transformation is, as we have noticed, closely paralleled by the birth of
      Atys from the almond. The idea at the root of this is that of
      self-creation or self-existence, as in the usual Egyptian phrase, "bull of
      his mother."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c5">The king flying up to heaven is a regular
      expression for his death: "the hawk has soared," "the follower of the god
      has met his maker," so Sanehat describes it (see ist series, pp. 97, 98).</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c5">This hawk-form of the king may be connected with
      the hawk bearing the double crown which is perched on the top of the <i>ka</i>
      name of each king. That hawk is not Horus, nor even the king deified as
      Horus, because the emblem of life is given to it by other gods (as by Set
      on a lintel of XVIIIth Dynasty from Nubt), and therefore the hawk is the
      human king who could perish, and not an immortal divinity. Further, this
      hawk-king is always perched on the top of the drawing of the doorway to
      the sepulchre</span><br />

      when we see the drawings of the <i>ba</i> bird or soul flying down the
      well to the sepulchre, it appears as if the hawk were the royal <i>ba</i>
      bird (ordinary men having a <i>ba</i> bird with a human head); and that
      the well-known first title of each king represents the royal soul or <i>ba</i>
      bird perched on the door of the sepulchre, resting on his way to and from
      the visit to the corpse below. The soul or <i>ba</i> of the king at his
      death thus flew away as a hawk to meet the sun.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c5">The veil drawn over the fate of the inhuman
      princess is well conceived. That she should die a sharp death has been
      foretold; but how Bata should slay the divine creation&mdash;his wife&mdash;his
      mother&mdash;is a matter that the scribe reserves in silence; we only read
      that "he judged with her before him, and the great nobles agreed with
      him." That judgment is best left among the things unwritten.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">The strange manner in which we can see incident
      after incident in the latter part of the tale, each to refer to some
      ceremony or belief, even imperfect as our knowledge of such must be, and
      the evidence that the whole being of Bata is a transference of the myth of
      Atys, must lead us to look on this, the marvellous portion, as woven out
      of a group of myths, ceremonies, and beliefs which were joined and
      explained by the formation of such a tale. How far it is due to purely
      Egyptian ideas, indicated by the Apis bull and the analogies in present
      African beliefs, and how far it is Asiatic and belonging to Atys, it would
      be premature to decide. But from the weird confusion and mystery of these
      transformations, we turn back with renewed pleasure to the simple and
      sweet picture of peasant life, and the beauty of Bata, and we see how true
      a poet the Egyptian was in feeling and in expression.</span><br />

      persons, and restored the town of Pehemato as it originally was. And

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">This tale of Setna only exists in one copy, a
      demotic papyrus in the Ghizeh Museum. The demotic was published in
      facsimile by Mariette in 1871, among "Les Papyrus du Musee de Boulaq; "
      and it has been translated by Brugsch, Revillout, Maspero, and Hess. The
      last version&mdash;"Der Demotische Roman von Stne Ha-m-us, von J. J. Hess"&mdash;being
      a full study of the text with discussion and glossary, has been followed
      here; while the interpretation of Maspero has also been kept in view in
      the rendering of obscure passages.</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Unhappily the opening of this tale is lost, and I
      have therefore restored it by a recital of the circumstances which are
      referred to in what remains. Nothing has been introduced</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c14">which is not necessarily involved or stated in
      the existing text. The limit of this restoration is marked by ]; the
      papyrus beginning with the words, "It is you who are not dealing rightly
      with me."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">The construction is complicated by the mixture of
      times and persons; and we must remember that it was written in the
      Ptolemaic period concerning an age long past. It stood to the author much
      as Tennyson's "Harold" stands to us, referring to an historical age,
      without too strict a tie to facts and details. Five different acts, as we
      may call them, succeed one another. In the first act&mdash;which is
      entirely lost, and here only outlined&mdash;the circumstances which led
      Setna of the XlXth Dynasty to search for the magic book must have been
      related. In the second act Ahura recites the long history of herself and
      family, to deter Setna from his purpose. This act is a complete tale by
      itself, and belongs to a time some generations before Setna; it is here
      supposed to belong to the time of Amenhotep</span><br />

      illustration. The third act is Setna's struggle as a rival magician to
      Na-nefer-ka-ptah, from which he finally comes off victorious by his
      brother's use of a talisman, and so secures possession of the coveted
      magic book. The fourth act&mdash;which I have here only summarised&mdash;shows
      how Na-nefer-ka-ptah resorts to a bewitchment of Setna by a sprite, by
      subjection to whom he loses his magic power. The fifth act shows Setna as
      subjected to Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and ordered by him to bring the bodies of
      his wife and child to Memphis into his tomb.</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">While, therefore, the sentimental climax of the
      tale&mdash;the restoration of the unity of the family in one tomb&mdash;belongs
      to persons of the XVIIIth Dynasty, the action of the tale is entirely of
      the XlXth Dynasty, for what happened in the XVIIIth Dynasty (second act)
      is all related in the XlXth. And the actual composition of it belongs to
      Ptolemaic times, not only on the evidence of the manuscript,</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c14">but also of the language; this being certified by
      the importance of Isis and Horus at Koptos, which is essentially a late
      worship there.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">Turning now to the details, we may note that the
      statement that Setna Kha-em-uast was a son of User-maat-ra (or Ramessu
      II.) occurs in the fourth act which is here only summarised. Among the
      sons of Ramessu historically known, the Prince Kha-em-uast (or
      "Glory-in-Thebes ") was the most important; he appears to have been the
      eldest son, exercising the highest offices during his father's life. That
      the succession fell on the thirteenth son, Mer-en-ptah, was doubtless due
      to the elder sons having died during the preternaturally long reign of
      Ramessu.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">The other main personage here is Na-nefer-ka-ptah
      (or "Excellent is the <i>ka</i> of Ptah "), who is said to be the son of a
      King Mer-neb. ptah. No such name is known among historical kings; and it
      is probably a popular corruption or abbreviation. It was pro-</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">nounced Minibptah, the r being dropped in early
      times. It would seem most like Mine-ptah or Mer-en-ptah, the son and
      successor of Ramessu II.; but as the date of Mer-neb-ptah is supposed to
      be some generations before that, such a supposition would involve a great
      confusion on the scribes' part. Another possibility is that it represents
      Amenhotep III., Neb-maat-ra-mer-ptah, pronounced as Nimu-rimiptah, which
      might be shortened to Neb. mer-ptah or Mer-neb-ptah. Such a time would
      well suit the tale, and that reign has been adopted here in fixing the
      style of the dress of Ahura and her family.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">This tale shows how far the <i>ka</i> or double
      might wander from its body or tomb. Here Ahura and her child lie buried at
      Koptos, while her husband's tomb is at Memphis. But that does not separate
      them in death; her <i>ka</i> left her tomb and went down to Memphis to
      live with the <i>ka</i> of her husband in his tomb. Thus, when Setna
      forces the tomb of Na-nefer-ka-ptah, he finds Ahura seated by</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">him with the precious magic roll between them and
      the child Mer-ab; and the voluble Ahura recounts all their history, and
      weeps when the roll is carried away by Setna. Yet all the time her body is
      at Koptos, and the penalty imposed on Setna is that of bringing her body
      to the tomb where her <i>ka</i> already was dwelling. If a <i>ka</i> could
      thus wander so many hundred miles from its body to gratify its affections,
      it would doubtless run some risks of starving, or having to put up with
      impure food; or might even lose its way, and rather than intrude on the
      wrong tomb, have to roam as a vagabond <i>ka.</i> It was to guard against
      these misfortunes that a supply of formulas were provided for it, by which
      it should obtain a guarantee against such misfortunes&mdash;a kind of
      spiritual directory or guide to the unprotected; and such formulas, when
      once accepted as valid, were copied, repeated, enlarged, and added to,
      until they became the complex and elaborate work&mdash;The Book of the

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c14">There is here also an insight into the
      arrangement of marriages in Egypt. It does not seem that anything was
      determined about a marriage during childhood; it is only when the children
      are full-grown that a dispute arises between the king and queen as to
      their disposal. But the parents decide the whole question. It is, of
      course, well known that the Egyptians had no laws against consanguinity in
      marriages; on the contrary, it was with them, as with the Persians,
      essential for a king to marry in the royal family, and also usual for
      private persons to marry in their family. Even to the present day in
      Egypt, although sister-marriage has disappeared, yet it is the duty of a
      man to marry his first cousin or some one in the family. The very idea of
      relationship being any possible impediment to marriage was un-thought of
      by the Egyptian; his favourite concrete expression for a self-existent or
      self-</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">created being&mdash;"husband of his mother "&mdash;shows
      this unmistakably.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The objection made by the king to the marriage of
      Na-nefer-ka-ptah and Ahura turns on the point that he has only these two
      children, and hence, if they marry the children of the generals, there
      will be two families instead of only one to ensure future posterity. The
      queen, however, talks the king over on the matter. The cause of Ahura's
      being troubled at the feast is not certain, but the king evidently
      supposes that she has been pleading to be allowed to marry her beloved
      brother, and when taxed with it she only expresses her willingness to give
      way to his exogamic views. The brief sentence, "I laughed and the king
      laughed," seems to mean that she pleased and amused her father so that he
      gave way, and immediately told the steward to arrange for her marriage as
      she desired. I have here abbreviated a few needlessly precise details. We
      also learn, by the way, that there was a regular registry of births, in
      which Mer-ab was entered.</span><br />

      <span class="font18">REMARKS 127</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">It appears that the court was considered to be at
      Memphis, and not at Thebes. This would not have been so arranged had this
      been written in the Ramesside times, but under the Ptolemies Memphis was
      the seat of the court&mdash;when not at Alexandria. The name of the
      priest, Nesi-ptah, also shows another anachronism. Such a name was not
      usual till some time after the XlXth Dynasty. Another touch of late times
      is in the antiquarian curiosity of Na-nefer-ka-ptah about ancient
      writings, "He did nothing on earth but read the writings that are in the
      catacombs of the kings, and the tablets of the House of Life." In the
      XlXth Dynasty there is no sign of interest in such records, but in the
      Renascence ancient things came into fashion, all the old titles were
      revived, the old style was copied, and very long genealogies were worked
      up and carved in the inscriptions. In such an age many a <i>dilettante</i>
      rich young man would amuse himself, as in this tale, with reading
      inscriptions</span><br />

      tombstones and the registers.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">The firm belief in magic which underlies all this
      tale might perhaps be thought to be inappropriate to the enlightenment of
      Greek times. We have seen how in the earliest tales magic is a mainspring
      of the action, and it is at first sight surprising that its sway should
      last through so many thousands of years. But there may well have been a
      recrudescence of such beliefs, along with the revival of interest in the
      earlier history. The enormous spread and popularity of Gnosticism&mdash;the
      belief in the efficacy of words and formulas to control spirits and their
      actions&mdash;in the centuries immediately after this, shows how ingrained
      magic ideas were, and how ready to sprout up when the counterbalancing
      interests of the old mythology were gone, and their place taken by the
      intangible spirituality of Platonism and the early Christian atmosphere.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">priest bargains for a large payment for his
      funeral, and to be buried as a rich priest. The enclosing of the magic
      roll in a series of boxes has many parallels. In an Indian tale we read:
      "Round the tree are tigers and bears and scorpions and snakes; on the top
      of the tree is a very fat great snake; on his head is a little cage; in
      the cage is a bird; and my soul is in that bird" ("Golden Bough," ii.
      300). In Celtic tales the series-idea also occurs. The soul of a giant is
      in an egg, the egg is in a dove, the dove is in a hare, the hare is in a
      wolf, and the wolf is in an iron chest at the bottom of the sea ("Golden
      Bough," ii. 314). The Tartars have stories of a golden casket containing
      the soul, inside a copper or silver casket ("Golden Bough," ii. 324). And
      the Arabs tell of a soul put in the crop of a sparrow, and the sparrow in
      a little box, and this in another small box, and this put into seven other
      boxes, and these in seven chests, and the chest in a coffer of marble
      ("Golden 10</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">Bough," ii. 318). The notion, therefore, of a
      series of boxes, one enclosing another, and the whole guarded by dangerous
      animals, is well known as an element in tales. The late date is here shown
      by the largest and least precious of the boxes being of iron, which was
      rarely, if ever, used in Ramesside times, and was not common till the
      Greek age.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The magic engineering of Na-nefer-ka. ptah is very
      curious. The cabin or air-chamber of men in model, who are let down to
      work for him, suggests that Egyptians may have used the principle of a
      diving-bell or air-chamber for reaching parts under water. Certainly the
      device of raising things by dropping down sand to be put under them is
      still practised. An immense sarcophagus at Gizeh was raised from a deep
      well by natives who thrust sand under it rammed tight by a stick, and by
      this simple kind of hydraulic press raised it a hundred feet to the
      surface. In this way the magic men of Na-nefer-ka-ptah raised up the chest
      when</span><br />

      he poured over from the boat.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font19 c5">There is some picturesqueness in this tale, though
      it has not the charm of the earlier compositions. The scene of Ahura
      sitting for three days and nights, during the combat, watching by the side
      of the river, where she "had not drunk or eaten anything, and had done
      nothing on earth but sat like one who is gone to the grave," is a touching
      detail.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The light on the education of women is curious.
      Ahura can read the roll, but she cannot write. We are so accustomed to
      regard reading and writing as all one subject that the distinction is
      rare; but with a writing comprising so many hundred signs as the Egyptian,
      the art of writing or draw-Ing all the forms, and knowing which to use, is
      far more complex than that of reading. There are now ten students who can
      read an inscription for one who could compose it correctly. Here a woman
      of the highest rank is supposed to be able to read, but not</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">to write; that is reserved for the skill of "a
      good writer, and a very learned one."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The writing of spells and then washing the ink off
      and drinking it is a familiar idea in the East. Modern Egyptian bowls have
      charms engraved on them to be imparted to the drink, and ancient
      Babylonian bowls are inscribed with the like purpose.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">An insight into the powers of the gods is here
      given us. The Egyptian did not attribute to them omniscience. Thoth only
      discovered what Na-nefer-ka-ptah had done as they were sailing away, some
      days after the seizure of the book. And even Ra is informed by the
      complaint of Thoth. If Ra were the physical sun it would be obvious that
      he would see all that was being done on earth; it would rather be he who
      would inform Thoth. The conception of the gods must therefore have been
      not pantheistic or materialist, but solely as spiritual powers who needed
      to obtain information, and who only could act through intermediaries.
      Further,</span><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18">REMARKS 133</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">nothing can be done without the consent of Ra;
      Thoth is powerless over men, and can only ask Ra, as a sort of universal
      magistrate, to take notice of the offence. Neither god acts directly, but
      by means of a power or angel, who takes the commission to work on men. How
      far this police-court conception of the gods is due to Greek or foreign
      influence can hardly be estimated yet. It certainly does not seem in
      accord with the earlier appeals to Ra, and direct action of Ra, in "Anpu
      and Bata."</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The power of spells is limited, as we have just
      seen the abilities of the gods were limited. The most powerful of spells,
      the magic book of Thoth himself, cannot restore life to a person just
      drowned. All that Na. nefer-ka-ptah can do with the spell is to cause the
      body to float and to speak, but it remains so truly dead that it is buried
      as if no spell had been used. Now it was recognised that the <i>ka</i>
      could move about and speak to living persons, as Ahura does to</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c5">Setna. Hence all that the spells do is not to
      alter the course of nature, but only to put the person into touch and
      communication with the ever-present supernatural, to enable him to know
      what the birds, the fishes, and the beasts all said, and to see the
      unseen.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">Modern conceptions of the spiritual are so bound
      up with the sense of omnipresence and omniscience that we are apt to read
      those ideas into the gods and the magic of the ancients. Here we have to
      deal with gods who have to obtain information, and who order powers to act
      for them, with spells which extend the senses to the unseen, but which do
      not affect natural results and changes.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The inexorable fate in this tale which brings one
      after another of the family to die in the same spot is not due to Greek
      influence, though it seems akin to that. In the irrepressible
      transmigrations of Bata, and the successive risks of the Doomed Prince,

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">There is an unexplained point in the action as to
      how Na-nefer-ka-ptah, with the book upon him, comes up from the water,
      after he is drowned, into the cabin of the royal boat. The narrator had a
      difficulty to account for the recovery of the body without the use of the
      magic book, and so that stage is left unnoticed. The successive stages of
      embalming and mourning are detailed. The sixteen days in the Good House is
      probably the period of treatment of the body, the time up to the
      thirty-fifth day that of wrapping and decoration of the mummy cartonnage,
      and then the thirty-five days more of lying in state until the burial.</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c14">ing at dice with Ceres, and the frequent presence
      of draught-boards in the tombs, shows how much the <i>ka</i> was supposed
      to relish such pleasures. The regular Egyptian game-board had three rows
      of ten squares, or thirty in all. Such are found from the XIIth Dynasty
      down to Greek times; but this form has now entirely disappeared, and the
      <i>man-galah</i> of two rows of six holes, or the <i>tab</i> of four rows
      of nine holes, have taken its place. Both of these are side games, where
      different sides belong to opposite players. The commoner <i>siga</i> is a
      square game, five rows of five, or seven rows of seven holes, and has no

      different kinds of men, and the squares were counted from one end along
      the outer edge; but what the rules were, or how a game of fifty-two points

      story among the dervishes in Palestine. They tell how the three holy
      shekhs of the Dervish orders, Bedawi, Erfa'i, and Desuki, went in
      succession to Baghdad to ask for a jar of water of Paradise from the
      Derwisha Bint Bari, who seems to be a sky-genius, controlling the meteors.
      The last applicant, Desuki, was refused like the others; so he said,
      "Earth! swallow her," and the earth swallowed her to her knees; still she
      gave not the water, so he commanded the earth, and she was swallowed to
      her waist; a third time she refused, and she was swallowed to her breasts;
      she then asked him to marry her, which he would not; a fourth time she
      refused the water and was swallowed to her neck. She then ordered a
      servant to bring the water ("Palestine Exploration Statement, 1894," p.
      32). The resemblance is most remarkable in two tales two thousand years
      apart; and the incident of Bint Bari asking the dervish to marry her has
      its connection with this tale. Had</span><br />

      Eastern beliefs&mdash;have lost his magic power over her, just as Setna
      loses his magic power by his alliance with Tabubua, to which he is tempted
      by Na-nefer-ka-ptah, in order to subdue him. The talisman here is a means
      of subduing magic powers, and is of more force than that of Thoth, as Ptah
      is greater than he.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The fourth act recounts the overcoming of the
      power of Setna by Na-nefer-ka-ptah, who causes Tabubua to lead to the loss
      of his superior magic, and thus to subdue him to the magic of his rival.
      Ankhtaui, here named as the place of Tabubua, was a quarter of Memphis,
      which is also named as the place of the wife of Uba-aner in the first
      tale.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The fifth act describes the victory of
      Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and his requiring Setna to reunite the family in his
      tomb at Memphis. The contrast between Ahura's pious ascription to Ptah,
      and her husband's chuckle at</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">seeing his magic successful, is remarkable. Setna
      at once takes the position of an inferior by addressing praises to
      Na-nefer-ka-ptah: after which the tomb became bright as it was before he
      took away the magic roll. Setna then having made restitution, is required
      to give some compensation as well.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c5">The search for the tomb of Ahura and Mer-ab is a
      most tantalising passage. The great cemetery of Koptos is the scene, and
      the search occupies three days and nights in the catacombs and on the
      steles. Further, the tomb was at the south corner of the town of Pehemato,
      as Maspero doubtfully reads it. Yet this cemetery is now quite unknown,
      and in spite of all the searching of the native dealers, and the
      examination which I have made on the desert of both sides of the Nile, it
      is a mystery where the cemetery can be. The statement that the tomb was at
      the south corner of a town pretty well excludes it from the desert, which
      runs north and</span><br />

      <span class="font18 c14">south there. And it seems as if it might have
      been in some raised land in the plain, like the spur or shoal on which the
      town of Koptos was built. If so it would have been covered by the ten to
      twenty feet rise of the Nile deposits since the time of its former use.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">The appearance of the ancient to guide Setna
      gives some idea of the time that elapsed between then and the death of
      Ahura. The ancient, who must be allowed to represent two or three
      generations, says that his great-grandfather knew of the burial, which
      would take it back to five or six generations. This would place the death
      of Ahura about 150 years before the latter part of the reign of Ramessu
      II., say 1225 B.C.: thus, being taken back to about 1375 B.C., would make
      her belong to the generation after Amenhotep III., agreeing well with
      Mer-neb. ptah, being a corruption of the name of that king. No argument
      could be founded on so slight a basis; but at least there is no contra-</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">The fear of Setna is that this apparition may
      have come to bring him into trouble by leading him to attack some property
      in this town; and Setna is particularly said to have restored the ground
      as it was before, after removing the bodies.</span><br />

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="font18 c14">The colophon at the end is unhappily rather
      illegible. But the thirty-fifth year precludes its belonging to the reign
      of any Ptolemy, except the IInd or the VIIIth; and by the writing Maspero
      attributes it to the earlier of these reigns.</span><br />

Produced by Eric Eldred and David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
